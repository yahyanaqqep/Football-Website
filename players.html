                        <h1>Mohammed Salah</h1>
                        <p>Mohamed Salah is one of the world's best and most prolific forwards and a serial winner with Liverpool FC since arriving at Anfield in the summer of 2017.
    
                            The Egyptian has been an unstoppable scorer following his transfer from AS Roma and has collected medals in the Premier League, Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup, Emirates FA Cup, UEFA Super Cup, Carabao Cup and FA Community Shield.
                            
                            He passed the 250-appearance and 150-goal marks – and entered the top 10 of the club's all-time leading scorers list – during a 2021-22 season in which he lifted the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, and helped his team reach the third Champions League final of his Liverpool career and finish second in the Premier League.
                            
                            
                            He won both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards for the second time after also doing so in 2017-18, a third Premier League Golden Boot and his first Premier League Playmaker of the Season prize.
                            
                            Salah's stellar consistency in terms of availability and performance saw him score 44 times for the Reds in 2017-18, 27 in 2018-19, 23 in 2019-20 and 31 in both 2020-21 and 2021-22.  
                            
                            In 2022-23, Salah overtook Robbie Fowler to become the club's all-time top Premier League goalscorer, and only four men have ever netted more for the Reds in all competitions.
                            
                            An astonishing repertoire of goals has ranged from jaw-dropping individual efforts – including a Premier League Goal of the Season winner against Manchester City – to sublime long-rangers, to close-range tap-ins and ice-cool penalties, such as his opener versus Tottenham Hotspur in the 2019 Champions League final.

                            The Welsh winger was the fan's favourite and set a record at Liverpool that will take a while to beat. With predictory instincts that were unmatched in the league during his time, he scored a record-breaking 346 goals in 660 games.
                            Rush made his international début, in May 1980, just before he officially became a Liverpool player. His Liverpool début came on 13 December that year in a First Division fixture at Portman Road against Ipswich Town. He was standing in for his future strike-partner, Kenny Dalglish (out with an ankle injury but at the time one of the most highly rated strikers in the world), and wore his No 7 shirt. At this stage, Liverpool were defending the league title and also contending for the European Cup, while Ipswich were emerging as surprise title contenders. Liverpool finished fifth (with Aston Villa winning the title), but they did win the European Cup (for the third time) and the League Cup (for the first time)

                            Steven George Gerrard MBE (born 30 May 1980) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ettifaq. Described by pundits and fellow professionals as one of his generation's greatest players, as well as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, Gerrard spent the vast majority of his playing career as a central midfielder for Liverpool and the England national team, captaining both.
    
    Born in Merseyside, Gerrard played for Liverpool from 1998 to 2015, winning nine trophies, including the UEFA Champions League, two FA Cups and three League Cups. He was Man of the Match in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final, in which Liverpool overturned a 3–0 deficit to defeat AC Milan on penalties, and the 2006 FA Cup final, which has been termed The Gerrard Final in homage to his performance. Despite success in cup competitions, he never won the Premier League. During his career, Gerrard was thrice selected in the FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11. Gerrard won 114 England caps between 2000 and 2014, captaining the team 38 times and scoring 21 goals. He played at three UEFA European Championships, in 2000, 2004 and 2012 (where he was named in the Team of the Tournament) and three FIFA World Cups, in 2006, 2010 and 2014.

                            Fernando José Torres Sanz (Spanish pronunciation: [feɾˈnando ˈtores]; born 20 March 1984) is a Spanish football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is the current manager of Atlético Madrid Juvenil A. Due to his consistent goalscoring rate as a young player, Torres came to be nicknamed El Niño ('The Kid'), which stuck with him throughout his career.[5] In his prime, he was praised for his pace, accurate finishing, and proficiency in heading, and was named in the FIFA World XI twice.
    
    Torres started his career with Atlético Madrid, progressing through their youth system to the first-team squad. He made his first-team debut in 2001 and finished his time at the club with 75 goals in 174 La Liga appearances. Torres joined Premier League club Liverpool in 2007, after signing for a club record transfer fee. The most prolific goalscoring spell of his career, he became the fastest player in Liverpool history to score 50 league goals and was often regarded as one of the best strikers in the world.[6] In 2008, he finished third for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his pressing, dribbling, and speed.[5][note 1]
    
                            Mané began his professional career with Ligue 2 club Metz at the age of 19, but he departed after a solitary season to join Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg in 2012 for a fee of €4 million, winning a league and cup domestic double in the 2013–14 season. Later that summer, Mané transferred to English club Southampton for a club record fee of £11.8 million. There, he set a new Premier League record for the fastest hat-trick, scored in 176 seconds in a 6–1 win over Aston Villa in 2015.

                        <p>
                            A Real Madrid symbol. The eternal captain who represented Madrid’s values on the pitch. Raul was a forward with an almost infinite instinct. He was an example for everyone, putting in the maximum effort in every game, irrespective of the opponent. He would give it his all, having an insatiable appetite, something that was evident with each action. He was always alert for rebounds. An excellent role-model for anyone who has ever dreamt of being a footballer.
    
                            On 29 October 1994 Raúl lived his first great moment with the Whites’ shirt. The forward made his debut at La Romareda Stadium. A week later he played his first derby against Atlético Madrid at the Bernabéu. He scored his first goal with a spectacular left-foot shot from the edge of the area. It went into the top corner, and contributed to his team’s victory (4-2), who went on to win La Liga title that season.
                             
                            Acclaimed in Spain, he conquered Europe. He played his first Champions League game at the age of 18. On 20 May 1998 he was in the team that won the club’s Seventh European Cup title beating Juventus Turin in the final. He repeated the experience in May of 2000 and 2002, scoring in both finals. He is one of the few players to have earned 100 caps with the Spanish national team.

                        <h1>ROBERTO CARLOS </h1>
                        <p>
                            His left foot was essential in Real Madrid’s conquest of more than ten titles. The Brazilian ace will always be remembered for his friendly nature, regularity, prodigious speed (he ran 100 metres in 10.9 seconds) and his tremendous power (his shots reached a speed of 140 km/h).
    
    His dream of being a footballer started to become a reality in 1986. Roberto Carlos joined União São João, where he matured as a footballer, excelling at all levels. In 1992, at the age of only 19, he was already an acclaimed footballer in his country. Palmeiras did not take long in signing him, and there he formed an unequalled left wing with Rivaldo, whom he would face many years later.
    
    After winning two league titles in Brazil he signed with Inter Milan in 1995, and a year later he transferred to Real Madrid. The integration of Roberto Carlos within the team was very successful. He played 11 seasons with the Whites, winning many major trophies, in particular three European Cup titles.
    
    In 2007 he left Madrid after contributing in another La Liga title. It would be the last contribution of one of the best left-footers to have ever graced the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. He holds the Whites all-time record for most number of games by a foreigner.

In his early years he showed great promise and in 1995 when he was 17 he joined the FC Barcelona youth system and moved into La Masia. He very quickly became a regular at the back for Barça B and on 2 October 1999 he made his long awaited debut for the first team.
    
                            Puyol had to wait until the season 2004/05 to win his first major trophy with the balugranes. He was the club captain and a key member of Frank Rijkaard’s side that claimed the league title that season, Puyol holding aloft the trophy in front of the Camp Nou crowd. Success continued as the following season with Barça retaining their league title and claiming the Champions League title in Paris. During Josep Guardiola’s time as coach Puyol continued to play a vital role in the Barça back four before injury finally caught up with him in his final two campaigns as a player. When he finally decided to hang up his boots, only Xavi Hernández had played more games for the Club in official competition.

                            Xavi (Terrassa, Barcelona, 1980) is, statistically speaking, the most successful player in Spanish football history. A midfielder from the club’s youth system, he’s the perfect example of the Barça values. The conductor of the FC Barcelona orchestra reads the game to absolute perfection. He always seemed to pick out the best-positioned players and had an uncanny knack for creating time and space.
    
    His mentor was Pep Guardiola and he’ would go on to become the midfield general’s successor. Xavi was astonishingly creative and was the veritable brain in the Barça engine. Though not physically strong, he used his wily knowledge to outwit opponents time and time again. There was no safer guarantee in the middle of the park than this exquisite player.
    
    He made his first team debut in 1998 under Louis van Gaal, and held onto his first team place for a remarkable seventeen seasons. It was under Frank Rijkaard in 2003 that he really started making his name, and by the time he was playing under his role model Pep Guardiola in the 2008/09 season, his legend was already set in stone. in his final season as a blaugrana. following the retirement of Carles Puyol, he became Barça captain. 
    
    He left Barça in 2015 with full honours, having broken the club record for first team appearances and won more titles than any other Spaniard before him. Xavi will always be part of the FC Barcelona heritage.

                        <p>
                            After five successful seasons with Sevilla, Dani Alves came to FC Barcelona in the summer of 2008. His physical strength earned him the nickname The Tarantula in his native Brazil and he was soon the indisputable first choice at right back for the blaugranes. In his eight seasons in a Barça shirt he made 414 appearance, 391 of which came in official competition, for an average of 49 games a season. With his solidity in defence, his rampaging runs down the flank, and his potent shot from outside the box, he was a vital component for four different blaugrana coaches: Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Tata Martino and Luis Enrique. Furthermore, his commitment to the team and his extrovert personality made him a firm favourite with the Barça fans and one of the stars when it came to celebrating the team’s many successes.
    
                            In the summer of 2016, Dani Alves would finally leave the club. He would pass through Juventus, PSG and Sao Paulo before returning to wear Blaugrana in January 2022. At the age of 38, Alves returned to Barça to put himself under the orders of Xavi Hernández and be part of the good second half of the season of the culer team.
                            
                            At the time of his departure in the summer of 2022, Dani Alves was second on Barça's all-time appearance list for foreign players, behind none other than Leo Messi. Also, he is one of the players with the most trophies. Football fans will never forget his raids down the right hand side in tandem with Messi, wreaking havoc on opposing defences.

                            Arjen Robben (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑrjən ˈrɔbə(n)]i; born 23 January 1984[citation needed]) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a winger. Known for his dribbling skills, speed, ball control and long-range shots, Robben is widely regarded as one of the greatest wingers and players of his generation.[4][5][6]
    
    Robben first came to prominence with Groningen, for whom he was player of the year for the 2000–01 Eredivisie season. Two years later he signed for PSV, where he became the Netherlands' Young Player of the Year and won an Eredivisie title.[7] The following season Robben's signature was pursued by leading clubs, and after protracted transfer negotiations, he joined Chelsea in 2004. Robben's Chelsea debut was delayed through injury, but upon returning to fitness, he helped Chelsea bring home two consecutive Premier League titles, and was the Premier League Player of the Month in November 2004. After a third season in England which was punctuated by injury, Robben signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €35 million.                        <br>

                            Franck Henry Pierre Ribéry (French pronunciation: ​[fʁɑ̃k ʁibeʁi]; born 7 April 1983) is a French former professional footballer who primarily played as a winger, preferably on the left side, and was known for his pace, energy, skill, and precise passing.[2] Ribéry has been described as a player who is fast, tricky and an excellent dribbler, who has great control with the ball at his feet.[3] While with Bayern, he was recognised on the world stage as one of the best players of his generation. The previous talisman of the French national team, Zinedine Zidane, once referred to Ribéry as the "jewel of French football".[4]
    
    Ribéry's career began in 1989 as a youth player for local hometown club FC Conti Boulogne. He left the club after seven years to join professional outfit Lille, but departed the club after three years after having difficulties adjusting. In 1999, Ribéry joined US Boulogne, where he played for two years. After spending two more years in the amateur divisions with two clubs (Alès and Brest), Ribéry earned a move to Ligue 1 club Metz in 2004. After six months with the club, Ribéry moved to Turkey in January 2005 to join Galatasaray, where he won the Turkish Cup.
