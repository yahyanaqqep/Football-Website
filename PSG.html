                        Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈeðinsoŋ kaˈβani]; born 14 February 1987) is an Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Argentine Primera División club Boca Juniors and the Uruguay national team. He is nicknamed El Matador ("The Killer") or Cazador ("Hunter") for his clinical finishing as well as his celebration, in which he makes a gesture resembling a bow and arrow. Cavani is considered one of the best strikers of his generation and one of Uruguay's greatest players.

                        Cavani began his career playing for Danubio in Montevideo, where he played for two years, before moving to Italian side Palermo in 2007. In 2010, Cavani signed for Napoli, who signed him on an initial loan deal before buying him for a total fee of €17 million. He helped them win the Coppa Italia in 2012 and established himself as the most dominant striker in Serie A.[4] In mid-2013, Cavani joined Paris Saint-Germain in France for a reported €64 million, at the time the most expensive signing in French football history. With PSG, Cavani won six Ligue 1 titles, five Coupes de la Ligue and four Coupes de France.                                               <br>
