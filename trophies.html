            <p>The competition is known for “giant killings”. This is when lower division teams beat the odds and knockout teams with far greater resources than their own. </p> 
            
            <p>The original FA Cup trophy was stolen in 1895 whilst held by Aston Villa and was never seen again. </p> 
            
                <p> A replica was used to replace the original, but a new design replaced it in 1911. </p> 
            
                    <p> The design is still the same to this day. Although, a replica was produced in 1992 to give to the teams in case anything happens to the original. </p> 
            
                        <p> The original 1911 trophy was valued £1 million on Antiques Roadshow in 2016. </p>

            <p> What’s just as shocking, is that despite the tournament running every year since 1992, only six teams have ever won the premier league! </p>
            
            <p> These are Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (4), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1) and Leicester City (1).</p>

            <p> The trophy consists of a golden globe which sits on top of a twisted column.

            <p> Of all the European football competitions, the Copa del Rey has one of the most beautify trophies. </p>

            <p>Its simplistic but statuesque design is sophisticated and commanding. </p>
            
            <p>After the 2010 winners Sevilla FC was allowed to keep the trophy for that year, a new trophy was made.</p>
