                    <h1>Carles Puyol</h1>
                    <p>Carles Puyol carried out his entire professional career at Barça but his beginnings were with his local side La Pobla de Segur. In his early years he showed great promise and in 1995 when he was 17 he joined the FC Barcelona youth system and moved into La Masia. He very quickly became a regular at the back for Barça B and on 2 October 1999 he made his long awaited debut for the first team.

                        Puyol had to wait until the season 2004/05 to win his first major trophy with the balugranes. He was the club captain and a key member of Frank Rijkaard’s side that claimed the league title that season, Puyol holding aloft the trophy in front of the Camp Nou crowd. Success continued as the following season with Barça retaining their league title and claiming the Champions League title in Paris. During Josep Guardiola’s time as coach Puyol continued to play a vital role in the Barça back four before injury finally caught up with him in his final two campaigns as a player. When he finally decided to hang up his boots, only Xavi Hernández had played more games for the Club in official competition.

                    <p>
                        A creative midfielder of extraordinary footballing quality, Iniesta stood out for his pure talent and his intelligence. Small in stature and elusive, his incredible skills on the ball made him a vital part of the blaugrana system. It is not for nothing that he is considered one of the greatest Spanish players of all time.

                        Iniesta future as a player was forever linked to that glorious period in which Barça won trophy after trophy whilst at the same time dazzling the fans with the football they played under Frank Rijkaard, Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Luis Enrique and Ernesto Valverde. It was a remarkable time for the blaugranes with the calming presence of Iniesta in the midfield a vital part of that success. His last minute equaliser against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge that gave Barça a place in the 2009 Champions League final will forever form part of the Club’s history.
                        
                        He left the Club on a high having completed the league and Copa del Rey double in the 2017/18 season. In his time at Barça Andrés Iniesta claimed no less than 32 trophies as a blaugrana and the man from Fuentealbilla will always have a place in the heart of every Barça fan. As the former Spain national team coach Vicente del Bosque said, “Iniesta will always be an example of how to play and how to behave as a professional.”

                    <p>
                        Xavi (Terrassa, Barcelona, 1980) is, statistically speaking, the most successful player in Spanish football history. A midfielder from the club’s youth system, he’s the perfect example of the Barça values. The conductor of the FC Barcelona orchestra reads the game to absolute perfection. He always seemed to pick out the best-positioned players and had an uncanny knack for creating time and space.

His mentor was Pep Guardiola and he’ would go on to become the midfield general’s successor. Xavi was astonishingly creative and was the veritable brain in the Barça engine. Though not physically strong, he used his wily knowledge to outwit opponents time and time again. There was no safer guarantee in the middle of the park than this exquisite player.

He made his first team debut in 1998 under Louis van Gaal, and held onto his first team place for a remarkable seventeen seasons. It was under Frank Rijkaard in 2003 that he really started making his name, and by the time he was playing under his role model Pep Guardiola in the 2008/09 season, his legend was already set in stone. in his final season as a blaugrana. following the retirement of Carles Puyol, he became Barça captain. 

He left Barça in 2015 with full honours, having broken the club record for first team appearances and won more titles than any other Spaniard before him. Xavi will always be part of the FC Barcelona heritage.

                    <h1>Daniel Alves  </h1>
                    <p>
                        After five successful seasons with Sevilla, Dani Alves came to FC Barcelona in the summer of 2008. His physical strength earned him the nickname The Tarantula in his native Brazil and he was soon the indisputable first choice at right back for the blaugranes. In his eight seasons in a Barça shirt he made 414 appearance, 391 of which came in official competition, for an average of 49 games a season. With his solidity in defence, his rampaging runs down the flank, and his potent shot from outside the box, he was a vital component for four different blaugrana coaches: Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Tata Martino and Luis Enrique. Furthermore, his commitment to the team and his extrovert personality made him a firm favourite with the Barça fans and one of the stars when it came to celebrating the team’s many successes.

                        In the summer of 2016, Dani Alves would finally leave the club. He would pass through Juventus, PSG and Sao Paulo before returning to wear Blaugrana in January 2022. At the age of 38, Alves returned to Barça to put himself under the orders of Xavi Hernández and be part of the good second half of the season of the culer team.
                        
                        At the time of his departure in the summer of 2022, Dani Alves was second on Barça's all-time appearance list for foreign players, behind none other than Leo Messi. Also, he is one of the players with the most trophies. Football fans will never forget his raids down the right hand side in tandem with Messi, wreaking havoc on opposing defences.
